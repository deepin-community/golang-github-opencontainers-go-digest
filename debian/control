Description: Common digest package used across the container ecosystem
 Package digest provides a generalized type to opaquely represent message
 digests and their operations within the registry. The Digest type is designed
 to serve as a flexible identifier in a content-addressable system. More
 importantly, it provides tools and wrappers to work with hash.Hash-based
 digests with little effort.
